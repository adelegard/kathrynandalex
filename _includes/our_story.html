			Kathryn and Alex graduated from the same class in high school however their stories differ on how they first met. Kathryn insists that they were in the same photography course together junior year but Alex says that he first laid eyes on Kathryn at a dinner party in 2009. Although they didn’t share many words that evening, Kathryn will never forget how floored she was by Alex’s smile while Alex remembers Kathryn’s amazingly beautiful eyes. Despite this initial spark, it was another six months before they were together again at another dinner party. This time, neither would miss the opportunity for a chat--and conversation flowed easily. With very poor timing, Kathryn would soon be moving to Philadelphia for nursing school, and the love-birds believed that was the end of a good start. Fortuitously, and to make a lengthy story short, Kathryn and Alex crossed paths several more times in the summer of 2010. By September of that year, they were in a full-blown long-distance romance. After two years, Kathryn moved back to Minneapolis and their agonizing, blissful cross-country romance came to an end. Now, four years later, their relationship has developed into something neither could live without and both Alex and Kathryn feel lucky to have their friends and family together to celebrate their wedding this fall!
